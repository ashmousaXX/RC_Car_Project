# 🚗 Wireless RC Car with Bluetooth Control (Arduino)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is about designing and implementing a **Wireless RC Car** prototype that combines **mechanical design in SolidWorks** with **Arduino-based Bluetooth control**.  
The car can move **forward, backward, left, and right**, detect obstacles using an **ultrasonic sensor**, and provide **visual and sound feedback** via LEDs and a buzzer.  
A servo motor is used for steering, while the chassis and body are fully modeled in **SolidWorks**.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 📱 **Bluetooth Control (HC-05)**: Wireless commands from a mobile app.
- 🚗 **Directional Movement**: Forward, backward, left, and right.
- ⚡ **Speed & Motor Control**: Using PWM and L298N motor driver.
- 🛑 **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic sensor integrated with auto-stop.
- 💡 **LED Indicators**: Directional LEDs for left/right turns.
- 🔊 **Buzzer Alerts**: Active when reversing or in obstacle situations.
- 🛠 **SolidWorks Mechanical Design**: Custom chassis, wheels, and mounts.
